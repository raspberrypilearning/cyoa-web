## Build your story website in HTML
Now you're going to make the webpages that will make up your story. Each page will be a separate ```.html``` file with a distinct and easily recognisable name. 

In the example story, you can see the pages are all simply titled with the main event on them: knock, open, torch, darkness etc. This makes it easy for you to know which page is which at a glance - it can get confusing sometimes!

--- task ---
Create a new, blank ```.html``` file for each one of the pages on your map.

The first one should be called ```index.html``, which is the conventional name for a 'home page', which is the first one that loads when you navigate to a URL.
Give the rest of your pages sensible filenames and paste the HTML boilerplate here at the top of each one ready to code:

title: HTML Boilerplate

```html 
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <title>Put a Good Title for this page in Your Story!</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>

<body>

Your Story elements go in here!

</body>

</html>
```

Remember to change the ```<title>``` to something relevant and cool!

HTML provides the structure for our pages, but to make the look really cool, we’ll need a stylesheet. You will be able to style your pages using CSS, which you should create now.

--- task ---
Create another blank file, called ```style.css```. This will be the stylesheet for your story website. 

Don’t start adding styling just yet, we’ll do that once we’ve checked our story works and plays properly.

Now that you have the major structure for your story website, you can start filling in each page’s ```<body>``` section with your story, using all the tags and tools you’ve learned about so far.

Don’t worry about linking all the pages yet, we will do that in the next step! For now, just go through each page of your story and write the narrative, including any choices the reader can make. You can also add images to your website if you like.
