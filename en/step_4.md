You should have rules for all the tags you used to create your story pages. In case you forgot what they are, here's a quick list:

+ body: the main part of your page
+ p: the text or paragraphs that make up your page
+ h1-h6: the different sized headings
+ ul & ol: unordered and ordered lists
+ span: special text you want to highlight
+ img: images on your page
+ a: hyperlinks
