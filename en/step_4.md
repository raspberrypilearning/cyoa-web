## Style up your story with CSS

In this step, we're going to use the CSS stylesheet you created to make your story website really pop!

Open your **style.css** file now, and you will see that it is blank. 

Add the rules for the different tags you have created into the sheet, remembering to add the curly brackets like this, so you can add the declarations inside them:

```body { }```
```a { }```
```h1 { }```
```p { }```

You should have rules for all the tags you used to create your story pages. In case you forgot what they are, here's a quick list:

+ body: the main part of your page
+ p: the text or paragraphs that make up your page
+ h1-h6: the different sized headings
+ ul & ol: unordered and ordered lists
+ span: special text you want to highlight
+ img: images on your page
+ a: hyperlinks

Now that you have rules for all the tags you've used, you can start adding the declarations that will create your styling. 

Go back over your previous projects to find some of the declarations you used previously. You can find a full list of CSS colours [here](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors.asp).
